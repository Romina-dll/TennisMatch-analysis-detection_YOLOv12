        "To showcase the model's performance, you would include visual comparisons here. You could take a few images or video frames from your test set, run the trained YOLOv5 model on them, and then display:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Original Image/Frame**: The input image before detection.\n",
        "*   **Detection Overlay**: The same image with the model's predicted bounding boxes and confidence scores drawn around the detected tennis balls.\n",
        "*   **Ground Truth Overlay (Optional)**: If you have labeled test images, you could also show the ground truth annotations for direct comparison.\n",

        "To objectively prove the model's effectiveness, the trained YOLOv5 model's performance was evaluated on the validation set using industry-standard metrics, as summarized below. These metrics reflect the model's ability to accurately detect and localize tennis balls.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Precision (P): `0.879`**\n",
        "    *   **Explanation**: This means that 87.9% of the objects the model *detected* as tennis balls were actually tennis balls. It reflects the accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Recall (R): `0.782`**\n",

        "*   **mAP50 (mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5): `0.815`**\n",
        "    *   **Explanation**: This is the average precision across all detected classes (in this case, just 'tennis ball'), where a detection is considered correct if its Intersection over Union (IoU) with the ground truth is at least 50%. A score of 0.815 indicates strong performance in detecting tennis balls with reasonable overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **mAP50-95 (mean Average Precision averaged over IoU=0.5 to 0.95): `0.352`**\n",
        "    *   **Explanation**: This is a more rigorous metric, calculating the average precision across various IoU thresholds, ranging from 50% to 95%. A value of 0.352 suggests that while the model is good at general detection (mAP50), there's room for improvement in very precise localization (getting very tight bounding boxes).\n",
        "\n",
        "The model demonstrates a good balance of precision and recall, with a strong mAP50 score for general tennis ball detection. The mAP50-95, while lower, is typical for this more challenging metric and can often be improved with further training or data augmentation.\n",
